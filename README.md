# Udacity-First-Project

## Investigating a Dataset
> The goal of this project was to explore the relationships between GDP and Population Growth, Life Expectancy and Fertility Rate, especially as these parameters extended across time periods and different countries. My datasets were obtained from gapminder.org as I selected the 'Gapminder World' dataset to investigate. The investigation led me to merge the GDP dataset with that of the other parameters to draw conclusions.

> For my exploratory ananlysis, I attempted to find out if a change in population affects GDP, the impact of GDP on life expectancy, as well as exploring if fertility rate has any relationship with GDP in the early 21st Century


> From the single parameter analysis, we observed that each of the first 3 parameters trended up year to year from 1990 to 2000. We acknowledged however that this did not necessarily imply the GDP growth is 100% dependent on the population and life expectancy growth : other external factors are most likely involved to varying degrees. The fertility rate chart was interesting as it was the only one that depicted a downward trend from years 2000 to 2010. It clearly showed minimal to no correlation with GDP and corresponded to the trend in modern times of families having fewer children by choice.


## Conclusions
> In my exploratory analysis and from my research, GDP is affected by a multiplicity of factors and while some relationships were drawn statistically and visually amonngst the parameters and GDP, this did not necessarily imply causation.

> I observed that while most countries grew in GDP and population between 1990 and 2000, there were a few exceptions, which highlighted the fact that GDP growth might not be exclusively dependent on population and that other economic and social factors like war and civil unrest could affect a country's GDP.

> I observed that life expectancy and GDP grew between 1990 and 2000 for most of our sample countries with a few exceptions. Again, this emphasized the mulitplicy of other external factors that could affect both parameters. Life expectancy, however, did show a strong relationship with GDP.

> Furthermore, I observed a negative correlation when we used our 2 sample countries to explore a relationship between GDP and fertility rate. The negative correlation could be seen in most countries in our datasets. This was the strongest parameter showing correlation did not imply causation.
